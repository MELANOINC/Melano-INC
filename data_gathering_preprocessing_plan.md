# Data Gathering and Preprocessing Plan for BERT Fine-Tuning

## Objective
Gather and preprocess lead data for training the BERT model in the NEURAL PROTOCOLâ„¢ system.

## Steps

### 1. Identify Data Sources
- **Internal Sources**: Check for existing databases or CRM systems containing lead information.
- **External Sources**: Explore publicly available datasets or APIs for lead-related data.

### 2. Data Collection
- Extract relevant fields such as:
  - Lead names
  - Contact information
  - Engagement history
  - Other pertinent attributes

### 3. Data Cleaning
- Remove duplicates and irrelevant entries.
- Handle missing values appropriately.

### 4. Data Formatting
- Convert data into suitable formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).
- Structure data to align with BERT input requirements.

### 5. Data Splitting
- Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

## Conclusion
This plan aims to ensure that the lead data is effectively gathered and preprocessed for optimal training of the BERT model.
